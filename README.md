### Context
I'm currently studying your company, and reached out to your co-founder for a brief LinkedIn message. Currently, I'm under the impression that your company currently wants to generate organic leads that is not coming from the founders' network.

I have seen efforts to establish thought leadership in the cyber security field but I sense that there seems to be a challenge waiting to be solved in generating organic leads and properly convert the leads into recurring customer.

I'd like to verify that thought and see if I'm delusional or not, below is my clarifying questions.
### Clarifying Questions
##### 1. What's the current challenge in acquiring a new Sales Manager for your company, what kind of personnel do you seek and what do you expect (results) from that personnel?
**Context**: I asked your co-founder about the sales role open in your company, I was informed your company is looking for a senior salespeople and preferably someone who already understands cyber security field. I also saw that it's been a while since the last time your company had a Sales Manager, I would like to understand more regarding the challenge your company is facing and understand what your company is trying to achieve.

##### 2. I sense that your company is trying to establish thought leadership in Indonesian cyber security scene, but with limited success. Can you walk me through what's possibly blocking your company from success and what success looks like?
**Context**: I noticed that you hired a Digital Marketing Manager for almost as old as your company, but your digital presence seems to have a disconnect to your company's offering. If I put myself in the shoes of your potential customer, I can't see a "path" or customer journey designed for me to discover your value proposition and services. Also, I'd like to understand what kind of organic leads that your company is after.

##### 3. If you have a magic wand, what would you wish in regards of cyber security talent pool in Indonesia?
**Context**: I can see that your company invested a lot in cultivating local talents, I genuinely want to see your company succeed in that.
